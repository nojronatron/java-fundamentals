# Linter Library

## Purpose

Exercise using File IO libraries and functions of Java to locate and load plain-text file contents.  
File content processing will also be done.  
Tests will be written to ensure proper operation of the Linter feature.  

## Linter Behavior

When the Linter Library is imported the functionality will be available via 1 or more methods.  
Linter will process a valid filename and return messages with error status information in String format.  

## This Project Is In-Flight

Time ran out today. Will revisit and complete later this week.  

## Tests

TODO:

Write tests in JUnit.  
Test the linter on a file that contains no errors.
Test the linter on a file that contains few errors.  
Test the linter on a file that contains many errors.  
Test the linter on an empty file.
